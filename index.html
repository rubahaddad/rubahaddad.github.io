            <h2>Hi, I am a problem solver. </h2>
            <p>I was involved in a wide range of problem-solving projects. From Architecture to Interactive Media. From Film making to Animation. I acted, directed, produced and was the voice over for many characters. I traveled the world and the seven seas and ended up in the web design and development field. The one thing in common in all my adventures is my approach - everything is a problem and I am capable of finding the solution. I have the mind, the heart and the soul as my tools for that.

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I was learning to windsurf when I lost track of time and space and did not know how to get back to the shore. The one idea that crossed my mind thinking I am going to die was to lie down and have a good sun tan before I die! I surprised myself of how good my lemonade is! </p>

              <p> I started coding when I was 14 years old and I presented my first project to Queen Noor of Jordan at that time! I recently finished a course with skillcrush in a very short time with great results.</p>

              <p>I am a visual thinker and illsutartion is my first language. I believe that the human mind needs to be treated with gentleness and respect and that is what I believe illustartions do!</p>

              <p>Coming from a design background, I approach photography with a great sense of design and composition. I do photography on a daily basis to document my daughters' journey.</p>
